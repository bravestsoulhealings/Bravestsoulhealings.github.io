<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Natalie. I am an intuitive faith healer. Growing up, I was very shy and often struggled with deep sadness, anxiety, and panic attacks. Even in my most difficult moments, I held onto hope that healing was possible.</p>

<p>I have always felt a strong spiritual connection to God, angels, and divine protection. Prayer was my refuge. Though I drifted from my faith for a time, my heart never fully left it.</p>

<p>During my darkest season, I searched for healing and peace. I explored many paths, but nothing filled the emptiness I felt — until I cried out to God completely and sincerely for guidance.</p>

<p>That prayer led me to spiritual healing. My first healing experience lifted a weight I had carried for years. I felt free, lighter, restored. My faith was renewed, and my calling became clear.</p>

<p>Today, I serve as an instrument of God’s healing and light for those who are suffering, overwhelmed, or spiritually burdened.</p>

<p><strong>This is not just work — it is a calling.</strong></p>
