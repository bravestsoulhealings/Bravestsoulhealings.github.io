  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Natalie. I am an intuitive faith healer. Growing up, I was very shy and nervous.
    I often isolated myself and struggled with severe sadness, panic attacks, and anxiety.
    Despite this, I always remained hopeful that things would get better.
  </p>
  <p>
    I felt a deep connection to my ancestors, my Guardian Angel, the Archangels, angels, and God
    throughout my life. There were nights I could not sleep, and I would pray and speak to God
    until I fell asleep. I grew up in a Catholic household, attending Mass as a child, but as I
    got older, I distanced myself from my faith.
  </p>
  <p>
    Between 2020 and 2023, everything felt very heavy. I searched for natural ways to heal my
    sadness, afraid to take medication, hoping there was another path. I explored tarot,
    reiki, and mediumship, even taking classes—but I always felt empty afterward.
  </p>
  <p>
    In May of 2023, feeling hopeless and defeated, I cried out to God, asking for guidance and peace.
    That is when I searched for spiritual healing and found a place that felt different from
    anything I had seen before. I booked an appointment without hesitation.
  </p>
  <p>
    That experience changed my life. For the first time, the sadness I had always carried was gone.
    I felt free, relieved, and lighter. My faith was restored, and I knew this was my calling—to
    be an instrument of God and help others in need.
